# Intel-NCS2-emotion-recognizer
Python script to using neural compute stick 2 to recognize emotions

# Introduction
Technology has been blamed for making us zombies and antisocial. But it does not have to be so. It all depends how technology is implemented. Current #deeplearning and #machinelearning applications are fun and full of possibilities. I got myself an Intel Corporation Neural Compute Stick 2, which can compute trained neural networks. 

I used it to do simple face detection and emotion recognition. Now my kids can practice robot control with facial expressions. With a little thinking it could be possible to make software and toys which would teach kids to express and control emotions and develop their abilities, not just to bush buttons. #intel #raspberrypi #teaching #toys #artificialintelligence #robotcontrol #ai  #robotics
